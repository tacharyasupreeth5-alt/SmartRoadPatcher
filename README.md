##Smart Road Patcher                    An automated road patching system using a **visual difference engine**, sensors, and a mechanical patching unit to detect and repair cracks in real time.

## Inspiration
Road cracks and potholes lead to accidents, delays, and costly repairs. We wanted to create an semi-automated, low-cost solution that detects cracks and patches them quickly, improving safety and infrastructure.

## What It Does
- Detects road cracks in real time using camera/LiDAR
- Uses computer vision to find surface irregularities
- Automatically patches the cracks using a mechanical system
- Low-cost and deployable in both rural and urban areas

##Built With
- Python
- OpenCV
- Raspberry Pi, Arduino
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Actuators, LiDAR
- AutoCAD / SolidWorks

##Cloud Platform
- Firebase (for real-time data and connectivity)

##Database
- Firebase Realtime Database

##Future Scope
- AI/ML crack classification
- Real-time mapping and dashboards
- Field testing and scaling
- Pilot deployment with civic authorities
